# How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! Not familiar with the codebase yet? No problem!
There are many ways to contribute to open source projects: reporting bugs,
helping with the documentation, spreading the word and of course, adding
new features and patches.


### Getting Started

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
2. Open a [new issue](issues), assuming one does not already exist.
3. Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.


### Making Changes

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository on GitHub.
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* This is usually the `master` branch.
* Please avoid working directly on `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units (if needed rebase your feature branch before
  submitting it).
* If your commit fixes an open issue, reference it in the commit message (#xxx).
* Make sure your code confirms to [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

These guidelines also apply when helping with documentation (actually, for
typos and minor additions you might choose to [fork and edit](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button)).


### Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
* Wait for maintainer feedback.


### First time contributor?

It's alright. We've all been there.


### Don't know where to start?

There are usually several TODO comments scattered around the codebase, maybe
check them out and see if you have ideas, or can help with them. Also, check
the [open issues](issues) in case there's something that sparks your interest. What
about documentation?  I suck at english so if you're fluent with it (or notice
any error), why not help with that?
